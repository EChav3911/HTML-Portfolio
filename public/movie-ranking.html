<h1>My Favorite Movies of all Time!!!</h1>

<h2>My Top Three Movies are...</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Jurassic Park</h3>
<p>The movie that made me fall in love with movies, and introduced me to the wonderful world of movie magic.  Look ma, there are dinosours on the screen!  Real life DINOSOURS!!</p>

<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>Cool, action packed, and fun.  This anime inspired sci-fi flick not only has style, but it's layered with philisophical takes and symbolism that will leave you thinking about the film long after you've watched it</p>

<h3>Aliens</h3>
<p>The first two were no brainers, the third was a little more challenging to choose from my list of amazing movies, but I went with Aliens. A baddass female protaganist leads a group of ragtag space marines, in a battle for survival against a horde of deadly apex preditor aliens. What's not to love?</p>
