<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm on a new career path at age 40.  I'm learning programming and computer science concepts with the goal of becoming a 
  web developer or software engineer.  I love what I've learned so far and feel motivated to see it through to the end. 
  I'm an animal lover, anime fan, sports enthusiest, and aspiring writer. I write short stories, and I'm learning to read and 
  write poetry. I enjoy math and science. I'm a glass-half-full type of guy, I try to stay positive and see the good in 
  everything. I love my family, I spend time with my mom, and help care for my brother who has autism. Life has had its highs 
  and lows, but I keep my resolve and stay focused on what's in front of me. Here's hoping this journey will be funa and full
  of challenges, and that I get to meet some interesting people along the way
